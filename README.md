# Building from source
1. Clone this repo. Usually with `git clone https://github.com/njshockey/generic-markdown-reader.git`.
2. Open the directory in your terminal or console and install the necessary npm packages with `npm install`.
3. To run the development server to test changes, run `npm run serve` and to build the production version, run `npm run build`. Built files will be in the dist folder.

# Special Thanks
Special thanks goes to the developers and contributors of [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Without them, the making of Generic Markdown Reader would have been infinitely harder!
