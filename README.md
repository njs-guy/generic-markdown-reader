- [ ] Open text and Markdown files
- [ ] Save files as txt, md, or html
- [ ] Parse CommonMark + Task lists
- [ ] Have a basic insert toolbar


# Special Thanks
Special thanks goes to the developers and contributors of [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Without them, the making of Generic Markdown Reader would have been infinitely harder!
